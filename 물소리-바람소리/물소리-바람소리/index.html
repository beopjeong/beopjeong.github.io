      <div><p>At Bulilam, I lived listening to the sound of the wind, but here in this new place I’ve moved to, I must always listen to the sound of the stream. The wind is always passing over the mountaintop. But in the low valley, a stream flows instead of the wind.</p>
<p>Although the sound of water and the sound of wind are both sounds of nature, the feelings they evoke are each different. When I listen to the sound of the wind brushing through the forest, I sometimes feel that life is so empty and feel an impulse to just pack up and leave for somewhere far away. And on days when a storm rages, it is desolate beyond words, and my heart becomes a barren field.</p>
<p>However, the house I’ve moved to this time is situated by a stream, so whether I like it or not, I have no choice but to listen to the ceaselessly flowing water day and night. For the first few days, especially after it had rained, the sound was quite distracting, but now I’ve grown indifferent to it, and it doesn’t bother me much. When I think of it as the sound of time flowing, the sound of life passing by, it gives me a new perspective on time.</p>
<p>Unlike the sound of the wind, which can sometimes sound harsh, dry, and hollow, the sound of water seems somehow moist and abundant. It also sounds as if it is endlessly washing something away.</p>
<p>Having once lived conspicuously in a high place, I now want to come down to a low place and live in seclusion. Having once tried living uniquely on my own, I now want to live mixed in among the many, buried in their shadow. If I cannot change this world with my own strength, I want to at least try to remodel the structure of my own life. Through new changes, I want to awaken the latent ‘me’. This is because I believe life is not about a goal or completion, but an endless experiment and attempt.</p>
<p>I lived at Bulilam for a full seven and a half years. When it was actually time to leave, I first felt sorry and sad toward the Buddha statue [佛像]. I have a connection with this Buddha, having enshrined it since my days at Daraeheon over ten years ago. The first time I saw it, brought from a ruined temple and placed on a table in the main room, my heart fluttered in a way it never had before. I was drawn to it at first sight. It was an ‘encounter’. I decided to enshrine it as my personal Buddha of vows (願佛). Although it wasn't an ancient Buddha (古佛), its elegant form pleased me.</p>
<p>When I moved from Daraeheon to Bulilam, I put my other belongings in the luggage compartment, but I carefully placed this Buddha statue in the seat beside me. Living alone, one can easily become lazy, but thanks to having this Buddha, I could not afford to be lazy in the mornings or evenings. It was that Buddha who listened to my vows, and it was that Buddha who generously accepted my ill temper and bad habits. Sometimes, when I was down at the main temple on business and people urged me to stay the night because it was late, I would refuse and struggle back up the mountain every time, because I couldn't bear to leave the Buddha alone in an empty house. To be bidding farewell to such a Buddha for a while, I couldn't help but feel sorry and sad.</p>
<p>The next neighbors that weighed on my mind were the trees I had planted and tended with my own hands. On the day I left, the machilus, juniper, and ginkgo trees seemed to be staring at me blankly, as if resentfully asking if I was going to leave them all behind and go alone.</p>
<p>Day in and day out, we basked in the clear sunlight together and gazed at the stars and moon together. We also weathered the snowstorms and the wind and rain together. In return for my pruning their branches and burying manure for them, they would cool the summer heat with their fresh green leaves and refreshing shade. As beings living together within one fence, we had shared a tender affection.</p>
<p>It’s something I often feel when packing for a journey, but this time too, as I was gathering and packing my things by myself, I suddenly felt a kind of hunger, a sense of the hollow essence of existence. I wondered if one might feel this same emptiness of being when, after living a full life, their turn comes and they disappear alone from this earth, on that journey back the way they came.</p>
<p>I felt I could understand, to some extent, the weary and lonely hearts of those who have to move from one rented room to another. In my own case, I was moving by choice, but for those without a home of their own who must live at the mercy of their landlord, I felt I could slightly comprehend their desolate and weary state of mind when, deflated by the single phrase “please vacate the house,” they must once again gather and pack their belongings. Is this not why people endure all sorts of sacrifices and try to live so diligently, all to secure a home of their own?</p>
<p>I spent a few busy days renovating the living space I would inhabit in my own style. I redid the shoddy electrical wiring to make it safe, and I cleaned out the attic and repapered it. I connected a pipe from the water pavilion (水閣) in the rear garden to bring water to one side of the yard, and I gathered flat stones from the stream to make a place for washing clothes.</p>
<p>I installed a cauldron in the fire pit to get hot water, but the fire wouldn't draw well. I took it apart again and lowered the lintel stone. Now it burns briskly. I also raised the chimney higher than before. I had erected what is commonly called a <em>mogyeontap</em> (木煙塔) at the temple—a playful name for a chimney from which the smoke of burning wood emerges.</p>
<p>I cut a pole three or four arm-spans long from the bamboo grove and set it up in the front yard as a clothesline. I found some old planks in the shed and, after some tinkering, made a small, one-foot-high auxiliary scripture desk (經床).</p>
<p>I hammered two large nails into the wall of the room to hang my kasaya and ceremonial robe. I broke off a branch of a half-bloomed camellia and placed it in a white porcelain paper-holder (紙筒), and the once-empty room seemed to fill instantly with the spirit of spring. Then I hung a scroll with a favorite phrase from the records of Zen Master Linji (臨濟), ‘즉시현금 갱무시절 卽時現今 更無時節’ (Right now is the present; there is no other time), and the room, which had felt so unfamiliar, became a little more comfortable.</p>
<p>‘Right now is the present; there is no other time.’ Whenever I encounter this teaching—not to dwell on the past that has gone by, nor to place hope in a future that has not yet come, but to live to the fullest right here and now—my spirits are lifted. We live right here, right now. If we can live each and every moment true to ourselves, giving our best, then under any circumstances, we will live a life we will never regret.</p>
<p>The night has deepened. It has been a while since the third-watch (三更) bell rang from the Dharma hall. Again, the sound of the stream at night. It sounds just like falling rain. Without a moment’s pause, the stream flows and flows until it reaches the sea. The stream of our lives, too, will flow on endlessly like that, toward the sea of union (合一). 1983</p>
